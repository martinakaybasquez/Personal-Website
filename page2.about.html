    <p style = "color: azure;">
        My name is Martina and I'm a 28 year old Filipino-Texan. I moved to the states when I was four and recently went back to the Philippines after a 10-year hiatus.
        It has taken a lot of self reflection to finally puff up my chest and say I'm a proud Pinoy and I'm really happy to be here!
        My passions include science and medicine. I have recently started a coding bootcamp and as a novice it is not for the faint of heart, but I haven't been challenged in a long time so this is an exciting endeavour to pursue!
        I am currently learning C#  as the programming language for the .Net framework. I still don't know what it is I want to pursue after graduation, but it's been incredibly interesting learning all the avenues I can veer into.
